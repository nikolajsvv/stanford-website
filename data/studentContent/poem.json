    "content": "Lips to creases, my tongue<br>meanders over crevices in peeling<br>skin. The earth has crystallized<br>into jigsawed rings. We, learning<br>to boil the air out of lungs, snap<br>brittleness out of keratin. I lose<br>the white of nails to slashes<br>swimming between rivers of black—<br>black blood, dried into slits. I want<br>to heal you, and so I grip your walls<br>and peel the breast of your bark back—<br>pink baby skin, swollen with embraces,<br>forgotten. You are ready to start<br>again. I pretend I haven’t starved<br>you as we fall into each other,<br>limbs tangling, murdered beast<br>erect with the waiting to fall.",
    "description": "This poem, “The Linden,” is part of my collection entitled THIS EARTH, OUR WOUND. At the core of this project, I wanted to articulate my current relationship with environmental reckoning as well as reconciling my feelings of hope and hopelessness towards our planet, of grief and gratitude for this beautiful earth, in order to help initiate and sustain ongoing conversations in the Stanford community and beyond. Many of these poems touch on my own fascination with the relationship between humankind and the planet, and more specifically the intricate dynamic between the human body and the earth, and the space in between. I am most interested in thinking about the space that exists between our physical selves and the earth’s own physical self, and how we can bridge this gap to redefine humanity with more earthly qualities, to be more in touch with the ground we walk on, to taste the air we breathe with more curiosity, respect, and awe.",
