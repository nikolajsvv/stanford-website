    "transcript": "Ten bodies sat in the water waiting<br/>Yelping and wading for when the wave comes,<br/>Its grand face like a bulldozer, like a breeze<br/>From the eaves of the mountain, like all<br/>The power and force in a smile<br/>from a stranger across the street<br/>passing by like busy bee, off on their day,<br/>their hand in a wave, wave, waving<br/>no, not at me, but still I wave back<br/>for they understand what it’s like<br/>to be wanted. I reply, twinkling,<br/>that it’s okay if you don’t want to spend the night<br/>But I, I – I’m sorry: I’m a snuggle bug<br/>And my boyish brain races<br/>When I start to think of past times<br/>And past places and the way<br/>That all of our faces in the water tonight<br/>Stop and glimmer, calm with the setting sun<br/>Splitting over the Pacific like a runny yolk<br/>Like a frying pan like breakfast back home<br/>And hot coffee on the pot, steaming,<br/>And the glad kettle rising up of<br/>The hazy misting opalescence of color<br/>Of purples and crashing pinks<br/>Of great joyous cacophonies like<br/>Monet’s heartchild like glory<br/>As it paints the ocean tonight.<br/>And to the two birds playing above me,<br/>The fraternal pelicans on their northbound journey,<br/>And the child, cold against wet sand,<br/>Buzzing about, kelp keeling in its hand<br/>Running back to the dry land<br/>Where mother waits, a stalk of hay in her hair,<br/>Smiling, open arms, congratulating her daughter<br/>For just having SO MUCH FUN – thank you.<br/>As she ran past me she said, or rather<br/>Spoke with the ringlets on her head<br/>“Blessed is He who makes the Future easy”<br/>And I knew it was true – true as I know that eyes<br/>Bite, that eyes shine of channel to the soul<br/>And that never ever do I want to let go<br/>When embraced, when made small, when erased from<br/>The worries of this world through passion and love.<br/>I took off my wetsuit and prayed to the cliffs,<br/>Rosy cheeks blasted of seawater and succulents<br/>– I know that they’ll never crumble completely.<br/>So how to explain this feeling save by kissing you<br/>Kissing every one of you here with me today,<br/>To you I say I LOVE YOU, I love you truly<br/>For you have made it past the jump of bum<br/>to bum, of heartbeat clenches in stresses<br/>and the anxiety of growing up and growing apart,<br/>I know that if this were a playground<br/>I wouldn’t chase you too hard. I’d tag you, knuckles cold<br/>But not too cold and run about till my lungs froze<br/>That burn of autumn time recess still present<br/>When I walk over to my sneaky link and pause<br/>And think “God! I am SO DAMN LUCKY to be alive.”<br/>The sun set and I walked back to car the whole time<br/>Goochy-goochy-gooing the little plants and bushes<br/>That survived this far till my phone rang, paused,<br/>Placed between my ear and my shoulder<br/>The way that my mother would talk to hers<br/>While making rice and turning the music down low,<br/>But instead of the sweet fragrance of fried onions<br/>I pick sand from between my toes – thank you for calling.<br/>A text like a thought where your voice like hug<br/>Like wrestling my brother on the rug remembering<br/>When he was smaller but now he tickles me till I cry<br/>And we hang out all night strumming guitar<br/>Bon Iver Jacques Brel Car Seat Headrest<br/>– hell even some Strokes<br/>Cause who doesn’t like the Strokes? –<br/>We got this whole cornucopia of music right at our fingertips,<br/>Let me make you a playlist.<br/>It fills me with so much joy to have you all here today,<br/>Gathered round like all the poets COHO jazz<br/>With each other so close – but not too close –<br/>Don’t touch me, I’m sorry<br/>I just get nervous when breath holds me<br/>Like the river’s breath or this tree’s breath<br/>As it heaves its leaves upwards the stream of its bark<br/>To tower over me and tell me in the thousandth symphony<br/>Of cicada and croaking toad and chirping bird and woodwind violins<br/>That fills evening silence like the bluebell mist of<br/>Eucalyptus pines as they expire the sweet smells<br/>Soothing us into respite: “It’ll be okay!” –<br/>Thank you for coming,<br/>Thank you for being here today;<br/>I know it gets hard sometimes &<br/>I know god damn well that it gets dark sometimes too,<br/>But the moon, in its flower petal like apple sticker on the evening sky<br/>Shines bright, every night,<br/>And every night leads every day leads<br/>The eternity that life has survived through love – thank you.<br/>",
