The visual display combines synthetic and natural materials in a dissonant manner, viscerally demonstrating the status quo of an invasive artificiality in nature. The creators hope that this project will bring an emotional impact to the viewer, reminding the viewer of the importance to respect and conserve nature.",

    "description": "The Stanford Tree Project seeks to bring together bottom-up curious tree-lovers, top-down resource dissemination, and community. In the vein of bringing nature and appreciation for our environment as the place where we live, work, and play, our project illustrates the brilliance of trees on campus and student relationships with them.\n\n On Saturday, December 2nd from 2-3:30pm, we hosted the first (to our knowledge) student-run Tree Walk. In admiration of the Trees of Stanford Project, stewarded by Sairus Patel, and the X-Tree Project, run by Professor Noah Rosenberg, we gathered 17 folks across many backgrounds to simply enjoy trees.
